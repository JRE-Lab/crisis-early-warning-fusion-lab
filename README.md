# Crisis Early‑Warning Fusion Lab

This repository contains materials for a crisis early‑warning fusion lab. It guides you through building a real‑time early warning system by collecting and fusing multiple data sources: news feeds, structured event data, weather anomalies, and economic indicators. The lab emphasises OSINT tradecraft – intelligence is produced from collecting and analyzing publicly available information【78954969918139†screenshot】.

## Overview

You will:

- **Define a destabilisation scenario:** Describe the actor, region and time horizon of concern.
- **Plan OSINT collection:** Gather news/RSS feeds, public event databases (e.g., GDELT/ACLED substitutes), weather APIs, and economic data.
- **Ingest and normalise:** Use Python or a notebook to parse RSS feeds and API responses into a unified dataset.
- **Build an indicators & warnings matrix:** Organise potential signposts of escalation and track them over time.
- **Analyze and brief:** Apply abductive reasoning to evaluate competing hypotheses and write a BLUF brief and analytic note with confidence levels.

All data used in this lab comes from public sources【78954969918139†screenshot】. This project illustrates how OSINT fusion and analytic rigor can support crisis early‑warning assessments.
